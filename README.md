I am a **Robotics Engineering Graduate** passionate about the intersection of **Perception** and **Control**. I enjoy the challenge of taking theoretical model s—like YOLO and Deep Learning— and finding ways to make them work reliably on physical hardware.

### Projects
* **Vessel Detection & Depth Estimation**: Developed a real-time system for detect and estimate the position of vessels using Monocular Depth Estimation (DepthAnythingV2) and Object Detection (YOLOv11) how Monocular Depth Estimation can improve maritime perception. Master's Thesis Project at CoE Marble (Zagreb,Croatia)
* **Pick & Place with Franka Emika Panda:** Engineered a ROS-based system for 7-DoF manipulation, implementing trajectory planning via MoveIt! and validating with Sim2Real transfer.
* **Self-Balancing Robot:** Modeled system dynamics and developed a PID/LQR control architecture on Arduino to stabilize a non-linear plant.
