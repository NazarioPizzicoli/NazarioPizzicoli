# Hi there, I'm Nazario Pizzicoli! 👋

I am a **Robotics Engineering Graduate** focused on the intersection of **Perception and Control**.
I enjoy the challenge of taking theoretical models (like YOLO and Deep Learning) and making them work reliably on physical robots.

Currently, I am a **Computer Vision Trainee** at the Centre of Excellence MARBLE in Zagreb, designing end-to-end pipelines for object detection and depth estimation.
